# def topological_sort(G, key=None):
#     """Returns a etl_step of nodes in lexicographically topologically sorted
#     order.

#     A topological sort is a nonunique permutation of the nodes such that an
#     edge from u to v implies that u appears before v in the topological sort
#     order.

#     Parameters
#     ----------
#     G : NetworkX digraph
#         A directed acyclic graph (DAG)

#     key : function, optional
#         This function maps nodes to keys with which to resolve ambiguities in
#         the sort order.  Defaults to the identity function.

#     Returns
#     -------
#     iterable
#         An iterable of node names in lexicographical topological sort order.

#     Raises
#     ------
#     NetworkXError
#         Topological sort is defined for directed graphs only. If the graph `G`
#         is undirected, a :exc:`NetworkXError` is raised.

#     NetworkXUnfeasible
#         If `G` is not a directed acyclic graph (DAG) no topological sort exists
#         and a :exc:`NetworkXUnfeasible` exception is raised.  This can also be
#         raised if `G` is changed while the returned iterator is being processed

#     RuntimeError
#         If `G` is changed while the returned iterator is being processed.

#     Notes
#     -----
#     This algorithm is based on a description and proof in
#     "Introduction to Algorithms: A Creative Approach" [1]_ .
