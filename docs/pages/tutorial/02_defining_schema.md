## Introduction


In this tutorial, we walk through a series of lessons that demonstrate the usage of DBgen's core functionality.

In this tutorial, Alice and Bob run a lab in which researchers make temperature measurements. First, we'll add the researchers' names into the database from a CSV. Next, we'll show how to use custom parsers to import temperature data stored in a directory of text files. Finally, we'll show a very simple analysis of the data: converting the temperature from F to C.

## Full Files

The code snippets in this section are taken from `schema.py`. The full file is shown below:

<summary>alice_bob_model/schema.py</summary>

```python3

```

## Entities

Using DBgen, entities are defined by subclassing dbgen.core.entity.Entity with
table=True.

Let's define a table called Person to store information about Alice and Bob's
researchers. In the example below, we define the Person table with just three
attributes: first_name, last_name, and age.


DBgen Entity is a subclass of Pydantic's SQLModel. Therefore, the syntax for adding
attributes to DBgen entities is the same as adding properties to Pydantic
SQLModels (attribute_name: data_type).

Additionally, we can give the table a name that will be used when creating the
database by setting the `__tablename__` attribute. This way, the name of your
python class and your database table don't need to be the same.

We can make columns optional (null values allowed) by wrapping the data type
with `Optional[]`, where `Optional` is imported from python's `typing` built-in
library.

```python3
{!../examples/alice_bob_lab/{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}/alice_bob_model/schema.py [ln:1,6-12] !}
```

### Identifying Attributes
Finally, you'll notice that we have set an attribute called `__identifying__`.

The distinction between identifying and non-identifying attributes is important
in DBgen. The identifying attributes answer the question, "what defines one row
in this table?" The identifying information is the minimum set of information
that is guaranteed to return one row. In more technical terms, the primary key
for each row in a table created using DBgen is a hash of that row's identifying
attributes. In this case, we have specified that a row in this table fully identified by the person's first and last name. With this design decision, it is impossible for us to insert two people with the same first and last name into the database.


### Adding foreign keys

Foreign keys specify the relationships between the entities in the schema. For
example, in this example, the same person may make many temperature
measurements. Let's define a table to capture temperature measurements, which
order they were captured in, and who recorded them.

The foreign key can be named anything, but it is very common to name the foreign key using the following pattern `TABLENAME_id` where `TABLENAME` is the name of the table the foreign key is referencing. The column type of a foreign key is the same as id on the referenced table, which is an `Optional[UUID]`. This type can be directly imported from `dbgen` as shown below. Finally, the value for the foreign key column can be automatically generated using the `Entity.foreign_key()` method.

```python3 hl_lines="1 9"

...
{!../examples/alice_bob_lab/{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}/alice_bob_model/schema.py [ln:14-] !}
